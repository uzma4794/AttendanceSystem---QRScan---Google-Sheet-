# AttendanceSystem---QRScan---Google-Sheet-
This project automates attendance marking for students using Google Forms. When a student submits their roll number, name, and PIN via the form, the script validates the submission and marks "P" in the corresponding column for that day in the Attendance. It prevents duplicate entries, invalid PINs, &amp; roll# not in the master attendance list.
